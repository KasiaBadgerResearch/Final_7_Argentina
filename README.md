# Does the percentage of the Argentine population using the Internet coincide with the share of international tourism receipts in total exports between 1995 and 2020?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study investigates the relationship between Internet usage and international tourism receipts in Argentina from 1995 to 2020. Descriptive evidence shows that Internet adoption (% of the population) increased sharply over the 25-year period, reflecting rapid technological diffusion and digital connectivity. In contrast, international tourism receipts (% of total exports) declined by roughly one-third, demonstrating a clear divergence between technological adoption and traditional service exports. These trends highlight that improvements in digital infrastructure and connectivity do not automatically drive gains in tourism-related economic activity, emphasizing the multidimensional and sector-specific nature of economic development. The findings underline the importance of targeted policy interventions to align technological progress with broader economic outcomes.

## 1. Question

Does the percentage of the Argentine population using the Internet coincide with the share of international tourism receipts in total exports between 1995 and 2020?

- **Proxy for digital adoption**: Individuals using the Internet (% of population)
- **Measure of tourism contribution**: International tourism receipts (% of total exports)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Individuals using the Internet (% of population)
  - International tourism receipts (% of total exports)
- **Coverage**: Argentina, 1995–2020
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Argentina.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a line graph comparing Internet usage and tourism receipts over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Internet usage (% of population)**: Increased dramatically from near zero in the mid-1990s to high penetration levels by 2020.
- **International tourism receipts (% of total exports)**: Declined by roughly one-third over the period, showing decreasing reliance on tourism in total exports.
- **Comparison**: The two indicators moved in opposite directions, highlighting that rapid digital adoption did not coincide with increases in tourism receipts.

(Table 1. Pivoted dataset)

## 5. Interpretation

- Argentina experienced a digital revolution, with the population rapidly adopting Internet technologies over the 25-year period.
- Simultaneously, the share of tourism receipts in total exports declined, indicating that tourism’s relative contribution to the economy decreased even as connectivity increased.
- The divergence suggests that digital adoption alone is insufficient to stimulate traditional service sectors like tourism, emphasizing the need for sector-specific policies and complementary investments.

## 6. Limitations

- Only two indicators analyzed; other factors influencing tourism or digital adoption are not captured.
- National-level data may obscure regional variation in Internet access or tourism performance.
- No causal relationships tested; results are descriptive.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Investigate the role of complementary infrastructure (transport, hotels, e-commerce) in linking Internet adoption to tourism.
- Incorporate subnational data to study urban vs rural trends in connectivity and tourism impacts.
- Explore econometric approaches to test causal relationships between digital adoption and service-sector growth.
- Compare Argentina’s trends to other Latin American countries to identify regional patterns.
